You may encounter a warning "warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in 3d.html." You can ignore it or you can use 
	git config core.autocrlf true to eliminate it.
Adding a file to a repository on a git server goes into 3 stages : 
<ol>
<li>Working copy (in your local computer) </li>
<li> Staging area ( when you use git add , you actually assign the files to be commited to the server) </li>
<li>repository ( when you use git commit , you send the files that in staging area to the repository).</li>
</ol>
</p>
</div>


<h3>Commiting Changes</h3>
<div>
	<p><span style="font-weight:bold;"> NOTE </span> Berfore commiting your first commit you have to configure Git with an Email and User name <p>
	<p> git config --global user.email "amr.abdeen@iedu-eg.com"</p>
	<p> git config --global user.name "AmrAbdeen"</p>
<p>git commit -m "Write a indication message of changes":
to commit our changes so we can keep tracking of it .commiting changes means we keep the first modified version of the project so ever after furthr changes we can get back to it again and modify whatever you want.</p>

	<br>
	<p> 
	 a commit shouldn't include unrelated changes - changes to the sidebar and rewording content in the footer.
	These two aren't related to each other and shouldn't be included in the same commit.
	Work on one change first, commit that, and then change the second one. 
	That way, if it turns out that one change had a bug and you have to undo it, you don't have to undo the other change too.

<h3 style="font-color:red">Git Ignore</h3>
<p>
	
If you want to keep a file in your project's directory structure but make sure it isn't accidentally committed to the project,
you can use the specially named file, .gitignore (note the dot at the front, it's important!). 
	Add this file to your project in the same directory that the hidden .git directory is located. 
	All you have to do is list the names of files that you want Git to ignore (not track) and it will ignore them.
